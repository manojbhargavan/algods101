<p>We basically have two major steps to derive the complexity of an algorithm:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Consider only the fastest growing term</li>
  <li>Take out the coefficient(s)</li>
</ul>

<p>Let us look at an example to understand the steps above. The below method takes in an integer n and calculates the running total of number from 1 to n.</p>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">runningTotal</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<p>Lets take a look at the steps involved for this function or algorithm.</p>

<div class="language-csharp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">static</span> <span class="kt">long</span> <span class="nf">CalculateRunningTotal</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">long</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">runningTotal</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="m">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// 1 step</span>
    <span class="c1">// Generally we do not consider assignment as a step,</span>
    <span class="c1">// but for simplicity we will say this takes say 1 step.</span>
    <span class="k">for</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">long</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="m">1</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="p">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="p">++)</span> <span class="c1">// n step(s)</span>
    <span class="c1">// Since the for loop is executed n times</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">runningTotal</span> <span class="p">+=</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">runningTotal</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// 1 step</span>
    <span class="c1">// Generally we do not consider returning as a step,</span>
    <span class="c1">// but for the sake of understanding let us say 1 step.</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So the number of steps of time which it take is 1 + n + 1 = n + 2 = O(n + 2)</p>

<p>Step 1: Consider only the fastest growing term â€“&gt; In this case O(n + 2), 2 is a constant and n increases as the input size increases hence n is the fastest growing term. So we remove 2 hence we have O(n).
Step 2: Take out the coefficient(s) â€“&gt; In this case O(n) does not have any coefficient.</p>

<p>Hence the time complexity of the above function is O(n) (spelled â€˜Big O of nâ€™), or Linear Time.</p>

<h2 id="few-examples-terms">Few examples Terms</h2>

<p>We will look at some made up number of steps for an unknown algorithm. This will help us understand the steps in depth although you might not encounter such terms in real world algorithms or may be you will. n is the input size for all of the below examples.</p>

<p>When we say â€œSTEP1â€ we mean â€œConsider only the fastest growing termâ€ and by â€œSTEP2â€ we mean â€œTake out the coefficient(s)â€.</p>

<ul>
  <li>T = O(an + b + 2c)
    <ul>
      <li>STEP1: The fastest growing term in the above term is <b>â€œanâ€</b>, since b and 2c are constants no matter how big it is as n grow significantly â€œbâ€ and â€œ2câ€ does not certainly grow and will have little to no impact on the runtime. â€œanâ€ on the other hand is directly related to n and is the fastest growing term. Hence after this step we are left with <b>O(an)</b> since we removed the constants b and 2c.</li>
      <li>STEP2:</li>
    </ul>
