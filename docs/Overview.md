Overview Of Big O Notation
==========================

What is Good Code
-----------------

Good code in short is readable, maintainable and scalable. Big O helps us with the scalable part of good coding practices.

What is Big O Notation
----------------------

Big O is used to defined time and space complexity of an algorithm which solves a single problem.

Why Big O Notation
------------------

The same algorithm or piece of code will not run for the same time in different computer / machines. A machine with a much higher configuration than say a basic laptop can run the same program much faster, so its not a good practice to measure the performance of an algorithm in terms of time that is say it takes 10 milliseconds to run since the run time heavily depends on the hardware the program is running on and even the language and/or runtime on which the program was written / intended to run.

Since computer are generally fast in this day and age, we as programmers need an alternate way of effeciently communication the time an algorithm is expected to run for regardless of the external factors like hardware/software and other factors.
